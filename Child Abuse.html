			<h1>Preventing Child Abuse & Neglect</h1>
			<p>
				Child abuse and neglect are serious public health problems and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that
				can have long-term impact on health and wellbeing. This issue includes all types of abuse and neglect
				against a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (such
				as a religious leader, a coach, a teacher) that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm
				to a child. There are four common types of abuse and neglect:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Physical abuse:</b> is the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical
						injury. Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, burning, or other shows of force against a
						child.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Sexual abuse:</b> involves pressuring or forcing a child to engage in sexual acts. It
						includes behaviors such as fondling, penetration, and exposing a child to other sexual
						activities. Please see
						<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/childsexualabuse.html"
							>CDC’s Preventing Child Sexual Abuse webpage</a
						>
						for more information.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Emotional abuse:</b> refers to behaviors that harm a child’s self-worth or emotional
						well-being. Examples include name calling, shaming, rejection, withholding love, and
						threatening.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Neglect:</b> is the failure to meet a child’s basic physical and emotional needs. These needs
						include housing, food, clothing, education, and access to medical care.
