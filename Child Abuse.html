			<h1>Preventing Child Abuse & Neglect</h1>
			<p>
				Child abuse and neglect are serious public health problems and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that
				can have long-term impact on health and wellbeing. This issue includes all types of abuse and neglect
				against a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (such
				as a religious leader, a coach, a teacher) that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm
				to a child. There are four common types of abuse and neglect:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Physical abuse:</b> is the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical
						injury. Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, burning, or other shows of force against a
						child.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Sexual abuse:</b> involves pressuring or forcing a child to engage in sexual acts. It
						includes behaviors such as fondling, penetration, and exposing a child to other sexual
						activities. Please see
						<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/childsexualabuse.html"
							>CDC’s Preventing Child Sexual Abuse webpage</a
						>
						for more information.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Emotional abuse:</b> refers to behaviors that harm a child’s self-worth or emotional
						well-being. Examples include name calling, shaming, rejection, withholding love, and
						threatening.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Neglect:</b> is the failure to meet a child’s basic physical and emotional needs. These needs
						include housing, food, clothing, education, and access to medical care.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Child abuse and neglect are connected to other forms of violence through shared risk and protective
				factors. This means preventing child abuse and neglect can also prevent other forms of violence. Using a
				public health approach to address shared risk and protective factors, we can prevent child abuse and
				neglect from ever occurring. For more information about preventing child abuse & neglect definitions
				please see

					Elements</a

			<h1>Signs & Syptoms of child abuse</h1>
			<p>
				A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. He or she may be afraid to tell anyone
				about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's
				vital to watch for red flags, such as:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Withdrawal from friends or usual activities</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Changes in behavior — such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity — or changes in
						school performance
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>An apparent lack of supervision</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Frequent absences from school</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Reluctance to leave school activities, as if he or she doesn't want to go home</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Attempts at running away</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Rebellious or defiant behavior</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Self-harm or attempts at suicide</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning signs
				are just that — warning signs. The presence of warning signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is
				being abused.
